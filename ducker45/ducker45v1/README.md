# DUCKER45v1

This is a compact 45 percent layout keyboard controlled by an MCU. Below, you'll find all the relevant details to help you build and understand this project.

## Layout
The keyboard follows a 45 percent layout, optimized for compactness while retaining essential functionality.

## Components
### Essentials
- MCU: Pro Micro
- Switches: Cherry MX style (consider 5-pin switches if building without a plate)
- Keycaps
- Diodes: 1N4148

### Optionals
- M2 screws
- M2 standoff
- Stabilizers

### Required Tools
-Soldering iron to solder the switches, the diodes and the MCU
-Pliers for trimming the excess leads of the diodes after soldering
-A USB cable is required for connecting the keyboard to your computer. Depending on the version of the MCU you are using, you may need a specific type of USB cable. For example, if using the Type-C version of the MCU, you will need a Type-C cable

## Required Abilities
To assemble this keyboard, you'll need basic tin soldering skills.

## Notes
- This is my first PCB design for a keyboard. While it may not be flawless, it has been tested and functions properly.
- The software for this keyboard is developed using QMK.
